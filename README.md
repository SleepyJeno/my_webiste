## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with `dist` directory. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Hosting

- After configuring HTML and CSS files, you need to acquire a domain name for your website. There are lots of options available, with the most popular ones being [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/en-GB) and [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
- Setup your webhosting. This could be either self-managed (with the likes of **AWS** or **Firebase**), or purchased as a service.
- Acquire and configure your SSL certificate. This mainly depends on the platform you are using to host your website.
